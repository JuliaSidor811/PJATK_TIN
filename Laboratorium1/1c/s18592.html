<p><strong>Gustav Elihaj Ahr</strong> (November 1, 1996 – November 15, 2017), known professionally as Lil Peep was an American rapper,

    A reason to shine, a reason like mine and I’m falling to pieces"</em></p>
<p>As a burgeoning artist, Lil Peep gained a significant amount of traction in the alternative hip-hop scene,
    establishing a better platform for himself to speak to fans about topics of his concern such as mental health.
    His lyrical themes include topics such as depression, drug use, past relationships,
    and suicidal thoughts and meshes together third-wave emo, alternative rock,
    pop-punk and dream pop with trap music and hip-hop.
    A close friend and the executive producer of Come Over When You're Sober,
    Pt. 1 said that Peep "wanted to give a voice to people that suffer from anxiety and depression,
    people who have been abused, bullied, and the people who were misunderstood like him.
    He had demons of his own and he faced those demons by creating music."</p>

<p id="cytat2"><em>"I don't feel much pain
    Got a knife in my back and a bullet in my brain
    I'm clinically insane
    Walkin' home alone I see faces in the rain"</em></p>


<p>Before dying at the age of 21, Lil Peep came to be an inspiration to outcasts and youth subcultures drawn together by the internet.
    He earned legions of fans in a short time from both hip hop and emo subcultures.
    Although he did not claim so himself,
    he is widely considered to have made a style of music that has been since regarded "emo rap".
    He has been credited as the leading figure of the mid–late 2010s emo music scene
    and is commonly cited as an inspiration for upcoming emo rappers.

<p class="pclear">Lil Peep actively talked about his issues with depression,
    anxiety and substance abuse and stated that he had bipolar disorder.
    Alongside drug use, Lil Peep struggled with suicidal impulses that date back to his adolescent years.
    On the track “OMFG” from his breakthrough mixtape Hellboy, Lil Peep talked about wanting to kill himself.
    During an interview, he was asked if he was suicidal. Lil Peep replied, <strong>"Yeah, it is serious.
    I suffer from depression and some days I wake up and I'm like, Fuck, I wish I didn't wake up.
        That was part of why I moved to California, trying to get away from the place that was doing that to me, and the people I was around."</strong>
    He continued, <strong>"I realized it was just myself—it's a chemical imbalance in my brain.
        Some days I'll be very down and out, but you won't be able to tell, really,
        because I don't express that side of myself on social media. That's the side of myself that I express through music.
        That's my channel for letting all that shit out."</strong>
